// Package ux holds the user experience implementation for GCS. Due to the incestuous nature of user interface code, I
// ultimately decided to combine all of the sub-packages for the user experience into a single large package. Prior to
// this, I had to introduce a number of artificial function trampolines in order to avoid circular references. The
// package structure at that time also prevented some the features I ultimately wanted to add from being implemented,
// again, thanks to circular references that were difficult or even impossible to resolve. A flat package structure
// eliminates those problems at the expense of making it more difficult to find things and requiring sometimes awkwardly
// long naming conventions.
